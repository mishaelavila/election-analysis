# Election Analysis

## Overview 
The purpose of this election audit was to report the results of an election for US Congress in Colorado. Using python we were able to automate the results rather than use Excel which might have taken too long and been less efficient. We made use of dictionaries, lists, and python commands to print and extract results from these.

## Summary 
The script that was used to determine the above results can be used to determine results of many other elections to come. The Election Analysis script breaks down the votes into percentages, total votes and highlights the winner and largest district turnout which can all really help with understanding where the upcoming candidates can focus on in the next election and where it is most conveninet for them to rally in. The most important thing is to be careful to cater specifically to each election type. The different variables and data paths need to be switched out with each election to give the most accurate results. This script was used to analyze county votes, county turnout, and each cadidates's votes and percentage, this all will need to be switched out depending on how big or small the election will be.
